## To Do

- [x] Looks up the Data
- [ ] Create a NLP model to predict genre based on Overview 


## Approach
- as usual i use `pandas` to read the csv files
- then using `pandas.dataframe.info` i achieve brief information about dataset columns. And indicated less than 5% of the total data.
- Thus the null value is less than 25% using delete rows approach is posible
- with `pandas.dataframe.dropna` i can delete rows that consist null value
- Beside that there is `release_data` column where has `object` as dtype instead of `datetime`
- Using `pd.datetime` i can solve the issue
- With the previous date column that has been converted. I could extract the specific years, month, and day according to its release date
- Using `pd.dataframe.describe` i achieve brief statistic
- After achieve the statistic before, i notice there are a movies that hasn't released yet and already has gain popularity
- using dataframe slicing with `release_year > 2023` i achieve most of movies that hasnt been released yet
- Using `wordcloud` i can achieve what keyword that most movies telling about
- To use `wordcloud` you should install it first just like pandas. in my case i use `conda install -c conda-forge wordcloud`
- After that, i did the analysis approach as usual (like getting information for each column, getting correlation, etc)
