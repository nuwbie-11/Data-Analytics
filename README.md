# Data-Analytics
:bowtie:

This repository is used to storing and showcasing on How i would do Data Analytical :smile:

`data_fork` is used to download or get the dataset specifically from kaggle. Keep in mind, if we wanted to fork datasets from kaggle, we need a token (usually named kaggle.json)

# Summary
1. For SQL Approach you can look up on [World University Rankings 2023](https://github.com/nuwbie-11/DataAnalytics101/tree/main/World%20University%20Rankings%202023)
2. For Analytical Approach by Pandas you can look up on [100-most-popular-english-movies-2023](https://github.com/nuwbie-11/DataAnalytics101/tree/main/10000-most-popular-english-movies-2023)
3. Thus for Publicity Dashboard, for example you can look up on [automobile-dataset](https://github.com/nuwbie-11/DataAnalytics101/tree/main/automobile-dataset)


## What inside each folder
- Each folder contains a dataset and a python notebook on how i basically do the analytics (Not all cases i apply the same approach)
- Followed by documentation or dashboard for example
  1. On [100-most-popular-english-movies-2023](https://github.com/nuwbie-11/DataAnalytics101/tree/main/10000-most-popular-english-movies-2023) i've added whole readme. inside that documentation are explained on what, how approach i use, insights and some to dos
  2. On [automobile-dataset](https://github.com/nuwbie-11/DataAnalytics101/tree/main/automobile-dataset) i've added dashboard as substitute for insight i've got
- On [World University Rankings 2023](https://github.com/nuwbie-11/DataAnalytics101/tree/main/World%20University%20Rankings%202023), i peformed some SQL queries to Clean and Transform data

Therefore i **RECOMEND** to look out on those each cases as mentioned before since every case is likely handled differently.
